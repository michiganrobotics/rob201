# ROB 201: Calculus for the Modern Engineer
[*University of Michigan Robotics Department*](https://robotics.umich.edu)

## Course overview

ROB 201 is an innovative approach to teaching calculus that integrates mathematical theory with computational tools and real-world engineering applications. This course breaks away from traditional calculus education by emphasizing the practical application of mathematical concepts through programming and numerical methods using Julia.

**Instructor:** Jessy Grizzle  
**Department:** Robotics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor  
**Semester:** Winter 2025

## Philosophy

This course recognizes that modern engineering requires both mathematical understanding and computational proficiency. Rather than treating calculus as an abstract mathematical exercise, ROB 201 demonstrates how calculus serves as the foundation for solving complex engineering problems, particularly in robotics and control systems.
