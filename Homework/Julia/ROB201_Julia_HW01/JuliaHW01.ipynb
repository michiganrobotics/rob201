                "**Example:**\n",
                "\n",

                "\n",

                "\n",
                "For more complex functions or when you need more readability and structure (e.g., multiple lines, loops, conditionals), you can use the `function` keyword. This method allows for the function body to span multiple lines between `function` and `end` keywords.\n",

                "**Example:**\n",
