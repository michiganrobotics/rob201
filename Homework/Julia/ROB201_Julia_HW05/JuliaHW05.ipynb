                "Look through the cell below to learn how to use derivatives to check monotonicity of a function over an interval (a, b). The code is based on the fact that the derivative of a functions measures its rate of change with respect to increasing values of its argument, say, $x$. If the rate of change is never negative, then the function never decreases and hence is monotonically increasing (you can also say it is non-decreasing, if you prefer). If the derivative is strictly positive everywhere in a region of interest, then the function is strictly increasing in that same region. By flipping the sign, we can check for monotoically decreasing or strictly decreasing. \n",
