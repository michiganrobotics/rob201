You, being a dual-major in Robotics and BME, have decided to do something about this. To provide some scientific gravitas to offset the major risk of your life-inexperience weighing against your application to do Human Subject Research (with the UM Institutional Review Board, aka IRB) you have developed a mechanical model of flag bearing. Your model has three links, with the shoulder serving as the base. Link 1 is the upper arm, link 2 is the forearem, and link 3 is the flag pole itself, gripped firmly in the hand. In the diagram below,  the angle of the wrist is captured by $\\theta_3$, the angle of the elbow is $\\theta_2$, and the angle of the shoulder is $\\theta_1$, all measured in radians.\n",

Importantly, your study will also take into account various constraints on how the flag is displayed to the crowd because, without any constraints, it does not take a genius to understand that effort might be minimized by dragging the flag on the ground, while simultaneoulsy obviating the overall purpose of the flag bearer being in the show. \n",

In the end, while finding roots is relatively easy via NLsolve, it is not a very efficient way to find local minima because there are simply too many stationary points in a typical cost function. This is why Project 2 will focus on **Gradient Descent** as a more reliable means to minimize a cost function, even in the presence of equality constraints."
